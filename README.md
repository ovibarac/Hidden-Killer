# Hidden-Killer
Try to kill as many people as you can without being detected


You are a demon disguised as a pumpkin. Kill as many passers-by as you can by clicking on them, but make sure to time your kills right so that no one suspects a thing.

Humans can see you kill if they are facing you and they are out of the fog.
